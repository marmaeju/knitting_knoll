## Description

---

A knitting resource that allows users to view different stitches, cast-on, and cast-off methods and tutorials linked from youtube to go with each. The app also includes a page that has links to various sites that sell patterns and materials. The user will have the ability to perform crud on stitches and hopefully the cast-on/off tables of the database.
